          This project revolves around developing a web-based car rental
          platform designed to establish direct connections between car owners
          and customers, eliminating intermediaries. The primary objective is to
          streamline the rental process, empowering owners to easily list their
          vehicles while offering customers a seamless experience to explore,
          book, and manage rentals. Leveraging contemporary web technologies
          such as responsive design and secure payment systems ensures both
          convenience and safety for users. Enhancing security measures include
          implementing license authentication and OTP (One-Time Password)
          verification. Users will authenticate their driving licenses, ensuring
          that only eligible individuals can rent cars. Additionally, OTPs sent
          during account creation bolster transaction security, mitigating
          unauthorized access and fraud risks. Facilitating direct communication
          between owners and renters enables personalized services and flexible
          rental terms tailored to customer preferences. By fostering
          transparent, flexible, and customer-centric interactions, this project
          aspires to revolutionize the car rental industry, prioritizing
          transparency, flexibility, and overall customer satisfaction.
